# Note-Taker

## Description

My project was a motivation to mmake a helpful page to make notes and stay organized.
I built this project to gain knowledge in Javascript aswell as learn more about the client server handshake.
This solves the problem of having to write it down on a piece of paper or somewhere to try to keep up with. This page will keep all notes you put into it and save them until you delete them.

## Usage 

This project Is very simple in how to use it. all you need to do is go to the page its on, type in your note with the text save it and it will store itself.

## Credits
